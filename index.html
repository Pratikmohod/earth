        <p class="about-para">
            Our home, Earth, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to harbor life. Approximately 4.54 billion years old, it's a dynamic world constantly shaped by geological processes.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
            A distinguishing feature of Earth is its abundance of liquid water, covering about 71% of its surface, leading to its "Blue Planet" nickname. This water is crucial for life and plays a significant role in regulating the planet's climate. The remaining 29% is land, comprising continents, islands, and various landforms like mountains, deserts, and plains.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
            Earth's atmosphere is a vital blanket of gases, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. This atmosphere protects life from harmful solar radiation, regulates temperature, and allows for the water cycle.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
            Beneath its surface, Earth is structured in layers: a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a thick mantle, and a thin outer crust. The movement of the molten outer core generates Earth's magnetic field, which shields us from solar winds. Plate tectonics, the movement of large sections of the Earth's crust, is responsible for earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
            Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, defining a year, and rotates on its axis approximately every 24 hours, causing day and night. Its axial tilt is responsible for the changing seasons. The presence of a single natural satellite, the Moon, influences tides and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt.
