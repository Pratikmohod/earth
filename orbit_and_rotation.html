               Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun, known as its mean solar day, is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time, which equates to 86,400.0025 SI seconds. Due to tidal deceleration, the Earth's solar day is currently slightly longer than it was in the 19th century, with each day varying between 0 and 2 milliseconds longer than the mean solar day. In contrast, Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, termed its stellar day by the IERS, is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0989 seconds. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), which is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 seconds. Consequently, the sidereal day is approximately 8.4 milliseconds shorter than the stellar day. Excluding meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the primary apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is westward at a rate of 15 degrees per hour, or 15 arcminutes per minute. For objects located near the celestial equator,
                this is equivalent to the apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon passing every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are roughly equal.

            <p class="orbit-para">
               Earth orbits the Sun as the third-closest planet, positioning it within the inner Solar System. Its average orbital distance is approximately 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), serving as the foundation for the astronomical unit (AU) and equivalent to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon. Earth completes one orbit around the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, which constitutes one sidereal year. The Sun's apparent eastward movement in Earth's sky is about 1 degree per day, meaning one apparent Sun or Moon diameter passes every 12 hours. This motion causes it to take, on average, 24 hours (a solar day) for Earth to complete a full rotation on its axis, bringing the Sun back to the meridian. Earth's average orbital speed is about 29.78 kilometers per second (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), a speed at which it could travel a distance equal to its diameter (approximately 12,742 km or 7,918 mi) in seven minutes, and the distance from Earth to the Moon (384,400 km or 238,900 mi) in about 3.5 hours. The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth-Moon system's shared orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. When viewed from the celestial north pole, the motions of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Similarly, from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits the Sun in a counterclockwise direction. The orbital and axial planes are not perfectly aligned: Earth's axis is tilted approximately 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to Â±5.1 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane.
